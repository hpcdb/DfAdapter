# DfAdapter

DfAdapter is a light-weight tool that collects provenance of human interaction data when users adapt a dataflow online (while it is in execution), relates with other data of interest and makes the provenance database available for online analytical queries.  Example of possible adaptations are: parameter tuning, dataset reduction, loop changes, etc.
